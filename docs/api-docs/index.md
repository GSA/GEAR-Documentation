### Overview

This section should contain an overview of the data provided and the API purpose.


##### Using the API
We built the API to be as self-documenting as possible, but if you find yourself overwhelmed, we organized this site into four major areas.

- [Getting started](getting_started.html) introduces you to the operations offered by the GEAR API.
- [API calls](console/) gives you a hands-on experience of those operations with an interactive console. (You will need to be on the GSA network for the interactive console to function properly)
- [Field reference](fields.html) lists and describes the type of information provided by the GEAR API.
- [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](FAQ.html) Here are answers to some frequently asked questions.
- [Contact Us](contact_us.html) If you need support or need to get in touch, this is the place to look.
