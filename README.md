## GEAR Documentation

This Github repo provides documentation on the GSA EA Analytics and Reporting (GEAR) webapp. 

The GEAR site is powered by open APIs. These APIs are documented [here](https://gsa.github.io/GEAR-Documentation/api-docs/), based on the [GSA API Documentation template](https://github.com/GSA/api-documentation-template.git). 

The GEAR Wiki is intended to house general information about GEAR and it's general development plan. Please keep in mind that the GEAR team is small, and we make our best efforts to keep this site current. If there are any issues, feel free to contact the EA Team at [ea_planning@gsa.gov](https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&to=ea_planning@gsa.gov).

## A Note about GEAR Access
GEAR is housed on the GSA internal network. In order to access any of the operational components, you must be connected to the GSA internal network either on premise or via VPN. This includes the "Try It Now" functionality on the API documentation Github page.
