## GEAR Documentation

This Github repo provides documentation on the GSA EA Analytics and Reporting (GEAR) webapp. 

The GEAR site is powered by open APIs. These APIs are documented [here](https://gsa.github.io/GEAR-Documentation/api-docs/), based on the [GSA API Documentation template](https://github.com/GSA/api-documentation-template.git). 

The GEAR Wiki is intended to house general information about GEAR and it's general development plan. Please keep in mind that the GEAR team is small, and we make no guarantees to keep this site current. Our tactical project management is in JIRA, under the project "GSA EA (GE)"

## A Note about GEAR Access
GEAR is housed on the GSA internal network. In order to access any of the operational components, you must be on that network (2FA is not currently sufficient). This includes the "Try It Now" functionality on the API documentation Github page.
